Getting Started

    git clone git://github.com/lloydchang/oe-made-easy.git
    cd oe-made-easy && ./core-image-minimal

This builds core-image-minimal from OpenEmbedded-Core for you :-)

HOWTO: Adding your local shell tab-key-autocomplete foo wrapper (in lieu of core-image-minimal)

    ln -sfn ./clean-build-self ./foo
    ./foo

Vision: Making OpenEmbedded Easier for You
Mission: Simplifying User Experiences Effectively :-)
