Getting Started

    git clone git://github.com/lloydchang/oe-made-easy.git; ./oe-made-easy/core-image-minimal

This bootstraps and cleanly builds core-image-minimal recipe from OpenEmbedded-Core for you :-) This initial clean build takes many hours, contingent on your computer's very fast disk I/O, large RAM, high number of CPU cores, and WAN throughput; it's High Performance Computing in action!
